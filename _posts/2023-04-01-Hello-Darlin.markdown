description: "Challenge: Americana without limiting the appeal to only United States customers. A lot of the inspiration for this kit came from various fabric collections and quilts combined with a paper suite produced by Close To My Heart a few years previously. The previous kit had excellent sales, so the goal was to replicate the feeling without duplicating the kit entirely.<br>
Role: Take the inspiration found by the Art Director and IPC team and create a suite of six 12”x12” patterned papers, a sticker sheet, several stamp sets, twenty four pocket scrapbook cards, digital art, and a coordinating accessory.<br> 
Process: This kit actually came together very quickly. I used a lot of open source reference photos for the flower illustrations and focused on a simple graphic look. This project was done in Adobe Illustrator using a Wacom Cintiq tablet. Once I had drawn the assets the patterns seemed to put themselves together. I turned in around thirty patterns which were then narrowed to the required six by the art direction team. I was then able to complete the sticker sheet, coordinating stamps and twenty four pocket scrapbooking cards.<br>
Outcome: I was really pleased with the overall cohesion of this kit. The success of this collection came largely from good inspiration and research in the beginning stages.<br>
